DIABETES STAGE PREDICTION:
This project will help to predict the Diabetes stage.

The motive of this project is that the people who are suffering from diabetes get to know that which stage they are in,Now a days there is no aware about the stage of diabetes this leads that everyone taking the Insulin injection,so to sort out this problem this project help them in a way.This helps them to take tablets to it no need of injection.

What is Diabetes?

Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.

Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your bodyâ€™s cells for use as energy.

With diabetes, your body doesnâ€™t make enough insulin or canâ€™t use it as well as it should. When there isnâ€™t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.

There isnâ€™t a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can really help. Other things you can do to help:

*Take medicine as prescribed.
*Get diabetes self-management education and support.
*Make and keep health care appointments.
*Diabetes by the Numbers
*More than 37 million US adults have diabetes, and 1 in 5 of them donâ€™t know they have it.
*Diabetes is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States.
*Diabetes is the No. 1 cause of kidney failure, lower-limb amputations, and adult blindness.
*In the last 20 years, the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes has more than doubled.

Types of Diabetes:
There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while pregnant).

Type 1 Diabetes:
Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake). This reaction stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people who have diabetes have type 1. Type 1 diabetes can be diagnosed at any age, and symptoms often develop quickly. If you have type 1 diabetes, youâ€™ll need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes.

Type 2 Diabetes:
With type 2 diabetes, your body doesnâ€™t use insulin well and canâ€™t keep blood sugar at normal levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). You may not notice any symptoms, so itâ€™s important to get your blood sugar tested if youâ€™re at risk. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, such as:

*Losing weight.
*Eating healthy food.
*Being active.
